# JWT-Sem

This repository contains materials and examples for my Bachelor's seminar in Software Security. It includes various operations with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), including encoding, decoding, and signature verification, hacking challenges from [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/challenges/web/). Additionally, it contains examples used in my presentation.

## Website

I have created a few small features for JWT and understanding the RSA algorithm on the page [https://jwt-woad.vercel.app/](https://jwt-woad.vercel.app/), with similar functionalities to [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) but with some Quality of Life Changes. These features are very simple and help illustrate the concepts.

## Features

- **Base64 URL Encoding and Decoding**: Convert data to and from Base64 URL format.
- **JSON Base64 Encoder**: Encode JSON data into Base64 format.
- **JWE**: Perform JSON Web Encryption operations.
- **Simplified RSA**: Simplified RSA encryption and decryption.
- **Signature Verification**: Verify JWT signatures.
